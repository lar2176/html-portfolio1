<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born May 18th, 1988 in China. I grew up in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province. From the age of four and a half, I was immersed in training to become a professional piano player. Growing up, I did not have many friends because I had to spend all my free time playing piano. Beginning in the fifth grade, I had to play piano an extra four hours a day. In addition to my extracurricular piano training, I attended the Shenyang Conservatory of Music for middle school, high school, and university.  The amount of extra time I spent playing piano increased each year until I was finally playing an extra eight hours a day. </p>

<p>Because of rampant corruption within Chinese universities, I knew that there was no future for me in China. I decided to escape China when I was 19 years old. Knowing I was about to leave the country, for six months I searched for every major about music that was front-leading in the world. Finally, I focused my eyes on a Music Therapy Major. After discovering that University of New York had the best Music Therapy program, I decided to follow through and come to the US to start my new life. </p>

<p>I landed in the US on July 19th of 2007. On my first day in the US, I met my husband in school. We fell in love after one month. He was my first boyfriend, and we got married one year later on July 15th 2008. We also became Christian right before we got married. We have been married for 15 years. We have an 11 year old daughter, eight year old son, and a five year old son. I never finished my music career path because I wanted to give my best to my family. However, now that my children are getting older, I think it's time for me to learn and grow in the job field that challenges me.  </p>

<p>After all these years, I noticed that music is not the only way for my life. I have found that I can learn anything I want, no matterr how old I am.  I fell in love with software development after I watched my son learning Javascript; I was interested and helped him with problems on my own without any training.  Software Engineering is a very exciting and very interesting subject to me!  I have set my mind and heart on becoming the best Web Developer that I can be. </p>
